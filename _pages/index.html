        Welcome to my little corner of the world. Here you will find a bit of information 
        about who I am, but my deeper intention is for this to serve as a personal canvas 
        for exploring my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/categories/homelab.html %}">curiosities</a>.

            The Pacific Northwest has always felt like home. It's been the generous
            backdrop for most of my life's seasons so far. I hope to spend the rest 
            of my days here. I've lived all over Washington state, but currently 
            reside in a small log cabin a couple hours north of Seattle with my 
            partner and a couple cats. It's peaceful.

            When not enjoying the Northwest's natural beauty, I spend most of my days
            working in tech. I've been writing code since the age of 11, and unbeknownst 
            to me, that first HTML book I purchased from CompUSA was also my
            ticket onto the rocket ship of the Internet's explosive presence in our 
            lives. I was very lucky to come of age with the Internet.

            In everything I do, curiosity is generally driving me. The destination
            is always growth of some form, whether I'm aware of it or not. This has 
            manifested in a lot of different ways throughout my life, and this site is 
            an effort to explore and make some sense of it.
