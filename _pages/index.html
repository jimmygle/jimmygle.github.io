        My name is <a href="/who">Jimmy Gleason</a> and I'm from the beautiful state of Washington. I'm 
        a person driven by a voracious <a href="#">curiosity</a>, with a firm belief that curiosity is 
        one of life's most powerful forces.

            The Pacific Northwest has always felt like home. It's been the generous
            backdrop for most of my life's seasons so far. I hope to spend the rest 
            of my days here. I've lived all over Washington state, but currently 
            reside in a small log cabin a couple hours north of Seattle with my 
            partner and a couple cats. It's peaceful.

            When not enjoying the Northwest's natural beauty, I spend most of my days
            working in tech. I've been writing code since the age of 11, and unbeknownst 
            to me, that first HTML book I purchased from CompUSA was also my
            ticket onto the rocket ship of the Internet's explosive presence in our 
            lives. I was very lucky to come of age with the Internet.

            In everything I do, curiosity is generally driving me. The destination
            is always growth of some form, whether I'm aware of it or not. This has 
            manifested in a lot of different ways throughout my life, and this site is 
            an effort to explore and make some sense of it.
