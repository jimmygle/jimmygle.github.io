It's the spring of 2021, and the COVID-19 pandemic is approaching its last days.
Things are opening back up, the sun is out and calling our names, and we'll soon
all enjoy some level of collective amnesia. This has all prompted some reflection 
on how I coped with this bizarre period of history. There's a lot to unpack in
that, but this post is about one of two primary "quarantine hobbies" I picked up:
<em>Homelabbing</em>.

## What is a "Homelab?"

This is a relatively easy question to answer with a bit of quick search engine 
sleuthing. But in brief, a homelab ~~is an at home chemistry lab for cooking up 
meth to sell so that little Jimmy doesn't go hungry during the pandemic.~~ is
setting up computer servers, networking routers/switches, and storage devices to
experiment with and satisfy our geeky curiosities.
