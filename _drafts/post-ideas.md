### Technical

* Jekyll learnings from setting this site up
  * Documentation kinda sucks


### Reflections

* Trading adventures
* "This too shall pass" - rebuilding the website
  * Looking back at past iterations of sites on my namesake domain
  * Past intentions and delusions about continually updating
  * Is a personal website necessary these days?
  * Privacy concern evolving - having my phone/email freely available
* [maybe] The occasional brutality of broad curiosity (ADHD)
  * Jack of all trades master of none
  * Satisfying curiosity is an addiction
  * Envy of people that have singular obsessions
  * There are pros to it of course
* Bitcoin mining
*
